**_ FIX - Needs updating to DOTT _**

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I am building out this project to try an encompass the skills I have gained as a developer so far.

The application is hosted and you can interact with it here:

[PinkPanther_Showcase_Project](https://pinkpantherreact.netlify.app/)

The backend is built in Node and Typescript using express library, all connected to a MongoDB hosted in Atlas.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To install the application locally please use this npm command.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### Installation

The application does utilise an environment file that you will not have access to for connecting to the backend.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Progress

There is a 'buildHistory' file in the application that I have been using to document what I have done, challenges and releases.

I had list of elements I was going to point out based on the authentication implementation but unfornately I have struggled with this today and just not achieved what I hoped.

If you view the 'issues' in GITHub you will see my thought process on tasks still outstanding and completed tasks.

**Positives**

- Do not return the password to the FE if request user details
- Security in place in the Index.js file
- Put everything in cookies rather than headers as this is safer
- Written in TS
- Uses ES6 modules rather than require
- I have not squashed the merges so can see commits
- You can view the issues so you can see what is left to do on the repos

**Negatives**

- Not had time to put this on a Postgres DB
